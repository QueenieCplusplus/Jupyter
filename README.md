# Programing Language Versions

diff versions of program engins matters with the compatibility of srd party pkg.

# Comparison between Python-Shell & iPython-Shell

the troublesome issued by python shell is that developer switch the multi-screens among tasks,
iPython amend this mentioned trouble.

and the magic cmd inluding the escaping cmd called '!' as pre-fix in front of the varible,
then the varible will be executed in the terminal in OS, not the Python Core.

# Comparison between Shell & Notebook

Both of them are trying to make the working env in GUI status. And Notbook has more gadgets 
than Shell, allowing developer to format the data, statements, and widget in JS.
